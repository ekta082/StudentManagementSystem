The Student Management System is a console-based application developed in Java that allows users to manage student records efficiently. This project was created as part of a Java programming internship to demonstrate mastery of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, file handling, and the use of collections in real-world scenarios.

It allows an admin to add, view, delete, and assign courses to students. All data is stored persistently using file handling, and the system uses a clean modular architecture following OOP principles.
